#Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock 
##Makers Academy Week 7 Task


###Aim

The aim of this task was to introduce us to JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax.

We had to implement the enhanced version of the classic 'rock-paper-scissors' game, and used Jasmine for TDD purposes.

###Other details

The task was set by Alex Peattie, [@alexpeattie](http://www.github.com/alexpeattie)

I paired with Arturo Ortiz, [@elsushi](http://www.github.com/elsushi)


###Features

The site contains a basic webpage, where the user plays against the computer. A message is printed after each turn saying which object the computer chose, and then announcing the winner.

There is a counter on the page which keeps a tally of the scores.

The app was built using Javascript, jQuery, Sinatra, HTML, and CSS

###To do


* Further refactoring of the code
* Develop scoring system so that it doesn't write score to a file
* Use Ajax to allow for saving of game progress
* Have a finite ending of the game where a certain number of points is reached
* Print out gameplay statistics at the end of a game
